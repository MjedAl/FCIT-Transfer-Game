# Hi. what i made was a game where player have to move around and reach the top based on his grades

# if a player pass the game it means that he can transfer so in that case we will check if the transfer is avaialbe this semester by reading the status from a database
# if it's open we will add his grades to the DB ( it's better to take it from ODUS to validate it but since i dont have access i'll ask the user to put it)
# there's a web-page where you can log in and see the students who are edible for the transfer and open or close the transfer
# https://www.a-fa.sa/FCIT_Transfer/ (or just open HTMLPART/index.html)

# Password: 123321 (i know it's bad password, it's just for demo)
# With that being said i have also two notes.
# 1- the code might not run as a .py because i used multiple libraries and edited in their code so it's better to open the .exe file
# 2- i have tried using arabic with printing other than the usual issues with LTR and RTL it's completly not supported in the windows console (when opening it from .exe)
#    so that's why i'll be printing in english :(.
